This project implements a line coding encoder, decoder, and scrambler with a digital data generator that generates completely random data sequences and subsequences containing consecutive 4 or 8 zeros. The code is written in C++ and utilizes the OpenGL library for graphical output. The implementation has been done on CodeBlocks, and it is recommended to run the code on this IDE.

<h2> Project Details </h2>

<h4>Language Used: C++ </h4>     
<h4>IDE Used:CodeBlocks </h4>

<h4>Libraries Used:</h4>    
- iostream
- vector
- random
- conio.h
- bits/stdc++.h
- windows.h
- GL/glut.h

<h2>Instructions to Proceed </h2> 

1. After successful compilation of the code, the output screen will prompt the user to press the required choice for data generation scheme.
2. Enter the data generation choice, and the system will then ask for the input data bit length.
3. The generated bit stream and its length will be displayed, along with the longest palindromic subsequence in the input bit stream and its length.
4. Simultaneously, the user will be prompted to choose one of the five different encoding schemes or an option to exit.
5. After choosing the desired encoding scheme, the output graph will be displayed on another screen.
6. Once the graph is displayed, the previous output screen will show:
    - Bit data stream
    - Bit data stream length
    - Generated longest palindromic subsequence and its length
    - Decoded data stream

<h2> Note </h2>

The code has been tested and implemented on CodeBlocks, as it uses features that may or may not be supported by other compilers.

Feel free to explore and use the code for your purposes!
