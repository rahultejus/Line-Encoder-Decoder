    <h1>Line-Encoder-Decoder</h1>
    <p>
        This project implements a line coding encoder, decoder, and scrambler with a digital data generator that generates completely random data sequences and subsequences containing consecutive 4 or 8 zeros. The code is written in C++ and utilizes the OpenGL library for graphical output. The implementation has been done on CodeBlocks, and it is recommended to run the code on this IDE.
    </p>

    <h2>Project Details</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Language Used:</strong> C++
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>IDE Used:</strong> CodeBlocks
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Libraries Used:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>iostream</li>
            <li>vector</li>
            <li>random</li>
            <li>conio.h</li>
            <li>bits/stdc++.h</li>
            <li>windows.h</li>
            <li>GL/glut.h</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Instructions to Proceed</h2>
    <p>1. After successful compilation of the code, the output screen will prompt the user to press the required choice for data generation scheme.</p>
    <p>2. Enter the data generation choice, and the system will then ask for the input data bit length.</p>
    <p>3. The generated bit stream and its length will be displayed, along with the longest palindromic subsequence in the input bit stream and its length.</p>
    <p>4. Simultaneously, the user will be prompted to choose one of the five different encoding schemes or an option to exit.</p>
    <p>5. After choosing the desired encoding scheme, the output graph will be displayed on another screen.</p>
    <p>6. Once the graph is displayed, the previous output screen will show:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bit data stream</li>
        <li>Bit data stream length</li>
        <li>Generated longest palindromic subsequence and its length</li>
        <li>Decoded data stream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Note</h2>
    <p>
        The code has been tested and implemented on CodeBlocks, as it uses features that may or may not be supported by other compilers.
